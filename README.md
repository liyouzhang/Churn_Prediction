# Churn Prediction for a Rideshare Company

A ride-sharing company is interested in predicting rider retention.

## Findings

* High-income users are less likely to churn: Using iphone, living in King's Landing (and to a lesser extent in Winterfell), and riding luxury cars are consistently negatively associated with the churn probability.
* Users who ride on both weekdays and weekend days are less likely to churn, as compared to users who ride only during weekdays or only during the weekend.
* Users who experiement low shares of rides with surge are less likely to churn. However, this trend is more evident in which suggests that surge seems to have a short-term effect on user's behavior.
* Ratings and average distance of rides do not seem to be associated with churn.

## Suggestions

The best strategy to be adopted will depend on the stage and priorities of the company.
* If the churn definition is aggressive (i.e. a user is considered to have churned if he/she has not used the service in 30 days), the company can make a profit of up to $8 per user by sending out $20 per year in promotions to users predicted to churn.
* If the churn definition is standard (i.e. 90 days), the company can make a profit of up to $4 per user by sending out $20 per year in promotions to users predicted to churn.

Assumptions:
* User value: $40 user/year
* Campaign cost: $20 user/year
* 100% success rate of campaign (profit is non-negative at >= 50% success rate)
* These figures are consistent with an annual revenue of $ 1 Billion and 5 million users (Lyft 2017).

## Data

* `city`: city this user signed up in
phone: primary device for this user
signup_date: date of account registration, in the form `YYYYMMDD`
* `last_trip_date`: the last time this user completed a trip, in the form `YYYYMMDD`
* `avg_dist`: the average distance (in miles) per trip taken in the first 30 days after signup
* `avg_rating_by_driver`: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips
* `avg_rating_of_driver`: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips
* `surge_pct`: the percent of trips taken with surge multiplier > 1
* `avg_surge`: The average surge multiplier over all of this user’s trips
* `trips_in_first_30_days`: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up
* `luxury_car_user`: TRUE if the user took a luxury car in their first 30 days; FALSE otherwise
* `weekday_pct`: the percent of the user’s trips occurring during a weekday

## Methodology

### 1. Feature Engineering
* Churn: The models try two definitions for churn:
    * Standard: A user is considered to have churned if he/she has not taken a ride in the last 90 days. This definition is broadly in line with the industry standard.
    * Aggressive: A user is considered to have churned if he/she has not taken a ride in the last 30 days. This definition is suitable for a company in an expansive stage, when it is willing to pay a relatively high retention cost to keep a user.
* Exogenous features
    * Categorical features with missing values were filled in with the mode for their specific group (by `city` and `luxury_car_user`). Missing value sin continuous features were filled in with the median value for such groups.
    * Categorical features, such as `city`, `phone`, and `luxury_car_user` were converted to dummy variables.
    * Continuous features that exhibited a log-normal distribution were logarized.
    * `user_lifespan` and `user_rated_driver` were created.

### 2. Modeling
The four models run were:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Adaboost
* Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression ensemble
* Random Forest + Logistic Regression ensemble

For each model, a Cross-Validation with Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters was conducted.
The metric used to compare performance was the Area Under the Curve for the Reiceiver-Operator Curve (AUC/ROC), which portrays the tradeoff between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for Classification Models.
